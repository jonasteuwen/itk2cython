itk2cython
==========

This repository is a Cython and ITK exercise but is not the proper way to mix Python and ITK: see the official [ITK Python wrapper](http://www.itk.org/Wiki/ITK/Python_Wrapping), as well as the excellent [SimpleITK](http://www.simpleitk.org/).

This code has been inspired by [CyITK](https://github.com/lantiga/cyitk), and the ideas here have been further developed to shape the Python wrapper that I developed for the [IRTK library](https://github.com/BioMedIA/python-irtk) from Imperial College London.
